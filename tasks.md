### Goals: ###
1. The game can be played by two to four playrs: (done)

2. The dice outcome is realistic enough:

3. A basic AI that plays with empirical strategies:

4. Players can play with drag-and-drop control or touch control: (done)


### Issues to fix: ###
1. When a player gets a 6 6 they should be able to roll the dice again before playing by choice
2. In touch controls, when a seed goes outside, the 'selected' styling isn't removed
3. In touch controls, when there are multiple seeds in a cell and one is selected then pushed behind (by double-clicking), it becomes impossible to select another seed
